## About

This app is a PoC for a catering menu builder. You create printable menus from a list of dishes, which are composed from a list of ingredients. The ingredients can be flagged as containing meat/seafood or gluten, or if they're spicy. Flagged ingredients will be displayed with a corresponding icon that flows through into the dishes and menus they are apart of.

Created using Angular (using TypeScript) and the Clarity Design UI Framework.
